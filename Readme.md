# Libraries

Botman: https://github.com/botman/botman


# Todo:
- Remove interfaces from test coverage in phpunit
- Add test coverage 100% ?
- Add glossary (squad, PR, GTM...)

# Later
- get notified who GTMed a PR
- be notified when a PR is closed but not merged ?
- Be notified who merged the PR ?

# To refactor
- Only at the end: Add VOs pour GTMCount NotGTMCount, Merged?
- Rename feature context: notify-ci-status-changed.feature / notify-ci-green.feature
- Only at the end of application layer: Rethink naming of application services (should it make the author appear?)

# Branches (no wifi)
